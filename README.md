# hi there, I'm Simon ðŸ‘‹


## introduction
I am a full-stack developer working for [craftworkz](https://craftworkz.be). I am interested in most technologies so you'll always find me messing with some kind of language, framework or application.

## current personal projects
- a mini coolors.co clone using #svelte
- a geographical poster generator
- simonluyten.be

## things I want to do
- make a contribution to some open source project.
- implement a pl guided by [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)
- implement a neural network from scratch using [nnfs](nnfs.io)
- build a raytracer in rust with [raytracer in a weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/)
